# Final-Project
## Description
We downloded data of trees and complaints from NYC open data, combined with zipcodes and zillow rent information to figureout the relationship between each of them. We firstly cleaned data and select all the columns we need in th further steps. Then, we create four tables(complaints_311, trees, historical_rents and nyc_zipcodes) and insert the data into postgre database. In part 3, we write 6 quries to figure out the the number of complaints in different zipcodes, the relationship between greenery and rent, etc. In Part 4, we visualize the data by different kinds of graphs to make a better understanding of the number of complaints per day or the recent 311 incidents reported from in certain area.
